# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Science & Machine Learning Projects** repository! This is a collection of projects where I have explored various data science techniques, machine learning models, and real-world datasets. Each project is implemented using **Google Colab**, making it easy to replicate and experiment with.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains hands-on projects that cover a range of topics in data science and machine learning. The projects include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## 📂 Project List
Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Grasp Force Prediction using Both Posture & Force Task** - Predicting grasp force based on posture and force task data.
2. **Diabetes Prediction** - A machine learning model to predict diabetes based on medical data.
3. **Python Gallery Plot** - Visualization of different plots using Python.
4. **Time Series Data Visualization** - Exploring and visualizing time series data using various techniques.

*(More projects will be added as I continue learning and exploring!)*

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- **Python** 🐍
- **Google Colab** 📓
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch** for ML & deep learning

## 📖 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BJB0/Data-Science-ML-Projects.git
   ```
2. Open the project notebooks in **Google Colab**.
3. Run the cells and experiment with different parameters.

## 🚀 Future Plans
